## My Celiac Adventure

You just got diagnosed with Celiac Disease :( You must survive the next 7 days by choosing to eat or skip meals.

Each meal may contain gluten. Eat a meal safely and reduce your hunger, or skip a meal and get hungrier. If you accidentally get glutened, you will also lose health. When your hunger reaches 100 or your health reaches 0 - you will die!

Good luck!
